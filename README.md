===============

Hello my name is Matheus. I am a technology student and I live in Jacareí / SP / Brazil.

I am curious, I have a passion for minimalism and technology, I really like artificial intelligence.

I also love tuning Arch Linux!

As a natural problem solver, I have an interest in science and science communication.

I speak fluent English, intermediate Spanish, and I'm learning German.

Most of my life I worked as a technology and consulting service provider.
(DevOps, IT Infrastructure, Full Stack Engineer and social media management)

Currently, I work as an IT infrastructure analyst supporting a large aeronautical company.
